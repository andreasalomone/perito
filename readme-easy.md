# AI Insurance Report Generator

This application helps insurance professionals create detailed and professional reports quickly and easily.

## Who Is This For?

This tool is specifically designed for **cargo surveyors** and other professionals dealing with insurance claims for transported goods. If your job involves assessing damage to cargo and writing detailed survey reports, this app is for you.

## What it Does

The main goal of this tool is to save you time and effort. Instead of writing reports from scratch, you can let our AI do the heavy lifting. This ensures your reports are always consistent, professional, and high-quality.

## How it Works

The process is simple and straightforward:

1.  **Upload Your Files:** Start by uploading all the documents related to a cargo claim. You can upload images (`.png`, `.jpg`), PDFs, Word documents (`.docx`), and Excel spreadsheets (`.xlsx`).

2.  **Let the AI Work:** The application's AI reads and understands all the information in your uploaded documents. It then automatically writes a complete draft of the survey report in professional Italian.

3.  **Review and Edit:** You can see the report the AI has created. Read through it, and if you need to make any changes, you can easily edit the text directly in the app.

4.  **Download Your Report:** Once you're happy with the report, you can download it as a Microsoft Word (`.docx`) file. The downloaded report will be perfectly formatted and ready to be shared or submitted.

This streamlined process helps you go from a collection of documents to a finished report in just a few minutes.
